Quiz in making

Introduction

qBond is a quiz with first set of questions taken from the "36 questions" set. The theory proves that after these 36 questions people tend become well bonded and grow closer. The idea is to make the simple representation of the questions and the logic behind it so it can be merged with a larger project in working. Overall, this project makes takes a part in an app that will be designed to help people keep the conversation going without getting bored, if invested ofcourse. This quiz has some main elements and it is focused on frontend (buttons, mock data). 

Features

Functionality

Keeping the track of skipped questions, if answere less then 8, users can't move onto the next section. Next section is not added due to lack of time investment, but will be added in the future. Simple design, working on landing page, no page switching for now since there was no need. After selecting Start Quiz button, info box will popp-up to explain some details of the game. Upon selecting "Continue", it is assumed that user understands the rules and the times is set off along with first question showing. On the quiz box there is a option to move one to the next question or to skip a question. Skipped questions are counted seperately with purpose of restrictions such as moving onto the next section without basic set (set I) questions being answered. 

Out of scope

Adding next set of questions
Conditioned move to the next section

Timer set more propertly with a different idea
Leaving users less space to shift and alternate the use of the app
Giving users less control of moving to next question just with purpose of getting the right score (time restriction).
